                <p>This is a community-driven initiative to combat phishing by turning deceptive emails into learning opportunities. Instead of ignoring suspicious messages, we invite users to submit them to our platform — helping others recognize and avoid scams.</p>
                <p>Our website showcases real phishing examples, making it easier for everyone to spot red flags. With a focus on usability, security, and education, this project blends web development, cybersecurity, and creative design into one impactful experience.</p>
                <p>Whether you're a curious learner or a seasoned developer, this is your chance to contribute to a safer internet — one email at a time.</p>
